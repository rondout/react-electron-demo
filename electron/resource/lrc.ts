Look at our hard work

is what you call comprehension

I don't understand I don't cry

Watch joys and sorrows every step of the way

Is it exhaustion or the bondage of dependence

come on can you repeat

let me understand let me cry

Let time stop again and see yourself clearly

Needless to say, if I pass through a barren land

happiness can't be touched

love is the kingdom of fools

Can't extricate myself, don't know how to quit

we can't go back to the beginning

Once beautiful but still not satisfied

love is a fool

Only when the answer is clear can we call a curtain call

The plot is laughing or crying

love is the kingdom of fools
